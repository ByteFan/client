# Example projects

The best way to kickstart the development is to have a look at the examples 
provided with the library or, of course, the tests. See the respective 
`/examples`  and `/tests` folder. 

The example projects are **NOT** meant to run as real applications, just 
examples on how to use the library. They are **not secure** in any way and 
should only be tested in a **development environment** and with test seeds. 
Their only purpose is to showcase the libraryâ€™s functionality.

## examples/kitchen_sink

This is an automatically generated project to test client- and remote-api
functions and is probably the most interesting one. You can use the browser to
execute functions in the library and see the outcome.

Run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` in the `/examples` folder to test it.

## examples/spammer

A simple spammer app that send 0i transactions to the tangle, just as the well
known JS spammer.
